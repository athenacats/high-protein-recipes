# high-protein-recipes
Quick high-protein, low-calorie recipes
This is my first web-dev project, under the instruction of The Odin Project.
I decided to go with the High Protein subject because that is something that I have an interest in (being a powerlifter).
I intend to have demonstrated a good understanding of HTML by the end of the first stage, with hopefully more skills to come such as CSS, JavaSCript and backend programming by the time I finally mark it as complete.
